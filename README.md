# Road Accident Risk Prediction – Kaggle Playground S5E10

This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle Playground Series S5E10 competition.  
The goal is to predict an **accident risk score** based on road conditions, traffic, and environmental features.

## Solutions

### 1. Advanced Feature Engineering + XGBoost
- Manual feature creation (interactions, base risk, etc.)
- Number of boosting rounds selected via cross-validation

### 2. AutoGluon
- Automated model selection & optimization
- Ensemble of LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost
- Automatic preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning
